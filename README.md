# InstaB0y
## Alpha version 1.0.0 / 22.08.19

*Instab0y* is a simple automation script written in python and using selenium. This script automates tasks and actions required 
in the *Instagram* social media. So this helps people like my self to spend less time on social media and get likes , views and followers.
For now the features of this script is so limited , and it will be improved and more features will be added. ___ you can check the **to do** section ___

### *Instaboy* features in Alpha version :
- liking posts in different hashtags



### To do (Features coming soon) :
- [ ] auto follow random accounts which have posted recently
- [ ] random comments
- [ ] Being less sus (avoiding instagram from banning your account in better way)
  - [ ] Adding time outs after some fast actions
  - [ ] Figuring out instagram triggers (what seprates a bot from human)
- [ ] Reading account info , number of posts to like , number of followers and comments from a config file.



### How to use :
In the recent version **Alpha 1.0.0** there's only the script *main.py*.
So you will need to edit/replace some parameters to make the script work for you.
**Required parameters: **
- Username    --> line 48
- password    --> line 49
- list of hashtags    --> line 126
- amount of posts to like in each hashtag   --> line 121

* remember , if your account was not active recently , do not set high amounts of hashtags and posts to like , this may make instagram to bann your account
or force you to change password. The second one happened for me.*
